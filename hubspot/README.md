# HubSpot MCP Server

HubSpot's MCP server is now available as a beta release. This enables AI clients to seamlessly take HubSpot actions and interact with your HubSpot data, opening up powerful new integration possibilities for our ecosystem. For more information and to provide feedback, visit https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp. You can also use the prompt `Provide feedback for HubSpot MCP tools` from your preferred client application!

**What is MCP?**

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging standard that allows AI models to interact with applications through a consistent interface. It acts as an abstraction layer over HTTP, letting AI agents access application functionality without needing to understand specific API protocols.
